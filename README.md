Recreate of bomberman in 3D in unity and asset files created in Blender

# Intro
This is a little project of mine back in 2015 when I was first learning how to program.
C# was one of the earliest languages I learned and I thought it would be fun to recreate my favorite arcade game of all time with C# within Unity.
